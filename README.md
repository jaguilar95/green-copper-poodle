# Password Generator

This is a random password generator. When the button is clicked two different types of prompts will be presented. The first will ask the user to provide a password length between 8 and 128 characters. The second type will prompt the user to choose to include a character set four times, with at least one character set selected. It will then display a random password in the text box. If the button is clicked again, the prompts will run again and generate a new password on the updated criteria.
